# CEAREX

This repository contains data and access scripts from the CEAREX O Camp over the flanks of the Yermak Plateau, Eastern Arctic Ocean, which took place in April 1989.

Currently, we provide

* RSVP microstructure:  1377 profiles of depth, temperature, conductivity (for salinity) and
dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (epsilon)

* TS150:  MicroCat sensor S/N 40 containing time, temperature, conductivity, and salinity at a depth of ~150m
